Nirvana Tech Fest 2025 – Official Website

📌 Overview

Welcome to the official repository for the Nirvana Tech Fest 2025 Website, designed for the annual fest organized by Tech Geeks Club in collaboration with the School of Computing.
This project was developed for Webathon 3.0, a frontend development challenge that tasks participants with designing a visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly event website.

The fest will be hosted on October 17 and 18, 2025, and will feature a blend of technical, cultural, and fun activities. From coding competitions to DJ night, the website serves as the digital face of the festival—offering schedules, event descriptions, highlights, photo galleries, and registration details.

This repository contains the static frontend implementation of the site (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), structured into multiple event pages, each with a consistent template and design.

2. Attractive & Modern Design – Create a landing page that captures attention and reflects the energy of a tech fest.


3. Ease of Navigation – Ensure that information is well-organized and accessible across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).


4. Responsiveness – Adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and responsive layouts.


5. Interactivity – Incorporate animations, hover effects, and call-to-action buttons for a dynamic user experience.


6. Hosting & Deployment – Deploy the site publicly via Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages, ensuring accessibility to all.

🛠 Tech Stack

The website is entirely frontend-based (no backend required). It uses the following technologies:

HTML5 – Structure and semantic content.

CSS3 – Styling, responsive layouts, grid/flexbox, animations, and transitions.

JavaScript (vanilla) – Basic interactivity (form links, navbar behavior).

React (optional) – Could be used for a more modular structure if extended, but current version is static HTML/CSS.

GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel – For deployment and hosting.
